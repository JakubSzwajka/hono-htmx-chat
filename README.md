# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built with the Hono framework and Bun. The application allows users to send messages and receive responses from an assistant.

## Problem Statement

In a typical chat application, there is often a delay between sending a message and receiving a response, which can lead to a poor user experience. This project aims to address this issue by ensuring that user messages appear immediately in the chat interface, even before the server has finished processing the request. This approach provides a more responsive and seamless user experience.

## Solution

### Instant Message Display

To achieve instant message display, the application uses the following approach:

1. **Frontend Handling**:
   - When a user submits a message, it is immediately appended to the chat interface using JavaScript.
   - The form submission is handled asynchronously to prevent page reloads and to provide a smooth user experience.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The server receives the message and processes it asynchronously.
   - A simulated delay is introduced to mimic real-world processing time.
   - Once processing is complete, the server sends a response message, which is then appended to the chat interface.

### Technologies Used

- **Hono**: A lightweight web framework for Bun.
- **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.
- **htmx**: For handling AJAX requests in the frontend.

## Features

- **Instant Message Display**: User messages are displayed in the chat interface immediately upon submission.
- **Server-Side Processing**: The server processes the message and sends a response, which is then appended to the chat.
- **Asynchronous Handling**: The server uses asynchronous handling to simulate processing time and generate responses.
